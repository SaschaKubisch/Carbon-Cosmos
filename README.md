 # Carbon-Cosmos


Carbon-Cosmos is designed to facilitate carbon offsetting transactions using the Cosmos Blockchain. The project is using the ICS-721 Multichain NFT standard for offset receipt generation and is build with Cosmos SDK, Regen Network, and Node.js, creating a robust and versatile solution for individuals and businesses to offset their carbon footprints through blockchain transactions on multiple blockchains.

## 🚀 Features

- **Carbon Offset Transactions**: Users can initiate carbon offset transactions, specify the receiver address, amount of funds, and receiver network, as well as the offset type and amount.
- **Carbon Offset API**: The API calculates the required carbon offset amount, allows selection of carbon credits, and manages transaction processing and receipts.
- **Smart Contracts**: Secure and efficient smart contracts for managing carbon credit pooling, burning, and interchain NFT receipt generation.
- **Database Management**: Robust system for storing transaction data, carbon offset details, and receipts.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Tools for tracking system performance, API usage, and carbon offsetting statistics.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation for the Carbon Offset API, smart contracts, and system architecture.
