The refined use case focuses on a B2B solution, where the API is integrated into the backend of other applications and called during the settlement process to handle transactions and carbon offsetting. Here's an updated description of the system:

Interoperable Bridge: Develop a cross-chain bridge that connects different blockchain networks, allowing carbon credits from various chains to be transferred to an interchain smart contract. This bridge can leverage solutions like the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol or other interoperability technologies.

Carbon Offset API: Create a generic B2B API that can be integrated into the backend settlement process of different applications. The API should enable these applications to handle transactions, manage carbon offsetting, and provide transaction type or associated service information.

Backend Integration: Partner applications integrate the Carbon Offset API into their backend systems. During the settlement process, these applications call the API to manage transactions and carbon offsetting on behalf of their users.

Transaction Processing: When a partner application processes a transaction and specifies the transaction type, the API calculates the equivalent amount of carbon credits needed to offset the entered CO2 amount. The API then transfers the user-selected carbon credits to the interchain smart contract using the cross-chain bridge.

Carbon Credit Burning: The interchain smart contract burns the required amount of carbon credits to offset the carbon footprint of the transaction.

Receipt Generation: After burning the carbon credits, the API generates a receipt that includes proof of the carbon offset, transaction type information, and transaction details.

Sending Receipt to Partner Application: The API sends the receipt back to the partner application, which can then provide the receipt to their users as verification that the transaction's carbon footprint has been offset and display the transaction type and details.

By creating a generic B2B API for handling transactions and carbon offsetting, you offer a versatile solution that can be easily integrated into various applications' backend settlement processes. This promotes sustainable practices across different industries by enabling applications to seamlessly offset the carbon footprint of their users' transactions.
