To fulfill the requirements for the Carbon-Cosmos project, you would need to make changes and additions to the file structure and codebase. Here's an outline of the files and code edits required to address the functional and technical requirements:

User Interface (Frontend):

Update the client/src/components folder to include components for connecting wallets, entering transaction details, and selecting offset types.
Implement the necessary logic and UI updates in the components to handle user input and display results.
Carbon Offset Calculation (API):

Create an API endpoint in the server/api/routes folder to handle the carbon offset calculation based on the provided transaction details.
Implement the necessary logic in the corresponding controller file in server/api/controllers to perform the carbon offset calculation.
Carbon Credit Selection (API):

Extend the API to include endpoints that allow partner applications to choose the type of carbon credits they want to use for offsetting transactions.
Add the necessary routes and controllers in the server/api/routes and server/api/controllers folders to handle the carbon credit selection.
Transaction and Receipt Management (API):

Implement API endpoints in the server/api/routes folder to handle transaction processing, generating receipts with carbon offset proof, and managing transaction details.
Create the corresponding controller functions in the server/api/controllers folder to handle the transaction and receipt management operations.
Carbon Offset API Design:

Refactor and extend the existing API routes, controllers, and services in the server/api folder to meet the specified API design requirements.
Update the API documentation in the server/api folder to provide clear and comprehensive information about the endpoints and their usage.
Carbon Credit (Regen) Bridge:

Create a new smart contract file, such as CarbonCreditBridge.sol, in the server/blockchain folder to handle the wrapping of Regen NCT tokens and bridging them to a carbon credit pool.
Implement the necessary functions in the contract to manage the wrapping and burning of carbon credits.
Smart Contracts:

Develop secure and efficient smart contracts, such as CarbonCreditRegistry.sol, OffsetTransactions.sol, and Receipts.sol, in the server/blockchain folder for managing carbon credit pooling, burning, and interchain NFT receipt generation.
Implement the required functions and event handling within the smart contracts to support the specified functionalities.
Database:

Update the server/db/models folder to include database models for storing transaction data, carbon offset information, generated receipts, user information, and analytics data.
Implement the necessary associations and validations in the Sequelize models to ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval.
Monitoring and Analytics:

Extend the server/db/models folder to include a model for storing monitoring and analytics data.
Implement the necessary logic and API endpoints to track system performance, API usage, and carbon offsetting statistics.
Testing and Quality Assurance:

Create test files, such as transaction.test.js and user.test.js, in the tests folder to perform unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for the implemented functionalities.
Write test cases to cover different scenarios and ensure the system's functionality, reliability, and security.
Deployment and Infrastructure:

Set up a scalable and secure infrastructure for deploying the system using cloud-based solutions or dedicated servers.
Implement proper backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity and system availability.
Version Control and Continuous Integration:

Utilize version control systems like Git to manage the codebase, facilitate collaboration, and track changes.
Integrate continuous integration (CI) tools, such as Travis CI
