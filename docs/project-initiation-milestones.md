1a. Project Initiation:

a. Define project scope, objectives, and deliverables:

Scope: Design and develop a carbon-offsetting solution that enables users to connect their wallets and perform offset transactions, with a Carbon-Offset-API that can be integrated into various dApps.

Objectives:

Develop a user-friendly interface for users to connect their wallets and perform transactions.
Implement a Carbon-Offset-API for B2B integration with dApps.
Develop secure and efficient smart contracts for carbon credit management and interchain NFT receipt generation.
Ensure the system is scalable, reliable, and secure.
Deliverables:

A functional web application with wallet connectivity and offset transactions capabilities.
Carbon-Offset-API with well-defined endpoints and documentation.
Smart contracts for carbon credit management and interchain NFT receipt generation.
Comprehensive documentation for the entire system, including API, smart contracts, and system architecture.
1b. Project Planning:
