Functional and Technical Requirements:

Functional Requirements:

User Interface (Frontend): The user should be able to connect their wallet, enter the receiver address, amount of funds to send, and receiver network. They should also choose the "offset-type", which specifies what should be offset by the transaction. By default, the offset-type is set to "transaction". If the user selects "custom", then an additional field will appear, allowing the user to enter the offset amount (amount of carbon credits to be burned).

Carbon Offset Calculation (API): The Carbon Offset API should accurately calculate the required amount of carbon credits to offset a given amount of CO2 emissions based on transaction type and associated service information.

Carbon Credit Selection (API): The Carbon Offset API should allow partner applications to choose the type of carbon credits they want to use for offsetting transactions.

Transaction and Receipt Management (API): The Carbon Offset API should manage transaction processing and generate receipts with carbon offset proof, transaction type, and transaction details.

Technical Requirements:

Carbon Offset API Design: Develop a RESTful or GraphQL API with well-defined endpoints and documentation, enabling easy integration into partner applications' frontend systems. The API should take as input the receiver [address], amount of funds [int], receiver network [int], offset-type [string], and offset-amount [int].

Carbon Credit (Regen) Bridge: Develop a wrapper contract to wrap Regen NCT tokens and bridge them to a carbon credit pool. If a user performs an offsetting transaction, the credits are taken from the pool and burned.

Smart Contracts: Create secure and efficient smart contracts for managing carbon credit pooling, burning, and interchain NFT receipt generation on supported blockchain networks.

Database: Implement a robust database system to store transaction data, carbon offset information, and generated receipts, ensuring data integrity and efficient retrieval.

Monitoring and Analytics: Implement monitoring and analytics tools to track system performance, API usage, and carbon offsetting statistics, providing insights for improvements and optimization.

Testing and Quality Assurance: Establish a rigorous testing process, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the system's functionality, reliability, and security.

Deployment and Infrastructure: Set up a scalable and secure infrastructure for deploying the system, using cloud-based solutions or dedicated servers, with proper backup and recovery mechanisms in place.

Version Control and Continuous Integration: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) and continuous integration (CI) tools to streamline development, deployment, and updates, ensuring efficient collaboration and code management.

Documentation and Support: Provide comprehensive documentation for the Carbon Offset API, smart contracts, and system architecture, as well as dedicated support for partner applications during integration and ongoing usage.

By addressing these functional and technical requirements, you can create a robust and versatile B2B carbon offsetting solution that can be easily integrated into various applications' frontend systems, promoting sustainable practices across different industries.
